### User Stories

**MVP:**
User will be able to:
* Log into the site 
* View a list of all the posts from all the users on the home page 
* * Create a new post once logged on 
* Modify/delete a post a user has created 
* Look at user’s profiles w/ all their posts 
* A user can like a post once 
* Creating a new user 

**Stretch goals:**
* Get a followers button working that allows users to see a list of followers
* Allow users to comment on other posts & share them onto their own profile
